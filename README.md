# ✈️ Airline Price Analysis

This project explores and visualizes airline flight data using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
It focuses on analyzing the relationship between different flight factors such as airline, source and destination cities, departure/arrival times, class, and ticket price.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into:
- How ticket prices vary between different **airlines**
- The influence of **departure and arrival times** on prices
- The number of flights from each **source and destination city**
- The effect of **travel class** on ticket cost
- Patterns in flight **duration** and **days left** before departure

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** → Basic visualizations  
- **Seaborn** → Advanced and aesthetic visualizations  

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations
Some of the major plots generated:
- Bar charts showing flight count per **airline**
- Comparative analysis of **departure vs arrival times**
- Average **ticket price per airline and class**
- **City-wise** flight distributions

Each visualization provides useful insights into how different factors affect flight pricing and availability.
